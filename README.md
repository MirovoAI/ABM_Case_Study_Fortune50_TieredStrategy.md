 Scaling ABM Across Three Tiers: $12 M Fortune 50 Account and Beyond
This case study illustrates how I applied Bev Burgess’s ABM framework across 1:1, 1:Few, and 1:Many tiers to drive measurable pipeline impact for a Fortune 50 healthcare client
Framework Reference: Framework adapted from Account-Based Marketing by Bev Burgess (ITSMA Framework – Identify → Expand → Engage → Convert → Grow).
Structure Used: Identify → Expand → Engage → Convert → Grow
Objective
Design and execute a tiered ABM strategy for a Fortune 50 U.S. healthcare conglomerate (Tier 1 1:1), a cluster of 15 mid-tier payer-provider accounts (Tier 2 1:Few), and a broad 1:Many demand-generation motion for 150+ healthcare IT prospects across APAC and Latam.
Target: Influence >$12 M in pipeline and improve SQL conversion by 30%.
Identify Account Selection & Prioritization
•	1:1 Tier: I Selected a $12 M Fortune 50 U.S. payer client with multi-region digital health expansion plans. Scored via firmographics (revenue >$12 M), intent signals, and technographic alignment.
•	1:Few Tier:  I Identified 15 payer-provider organizations (~$2M–$5M revenue) with common pain points in care coordination and digital interoperability.
•	1:Many Tiers:  I Segmented 150+ mid-market prospects using intent data (6sense + LinkedIn Insights) around EHR integration and compliance topics.
 Expand Insight and Intelligence Building
•	I then Conducted C-suite stakeholder mapping across IT, Operations, and Clinical Innovation.
•	Then Used Salesforce + LinkedIn Navigator to build a buying-committee matrix (~20 contacts).
•	Last but not the least, I Leveraged GenAI to personalize value propositions based on content consumption and industry news signals.
 Engage Content & Channel Orchestration
Tier	Approach	Key Assets	Channels Used
1:1 Fortune 50	 I Co-created “Digital Care Blueprint” whitepaper and ROI calculator for the client’s innovation team.	Custom landing page, executive video message, ROI dashboard demo.	LinkedIn InMail + direct sales outreach + C-suite webinar.
1:Few (15 accounts)	Industry-clustered microsites with personalized case studies and benchmarks.	3 industry ebooks + email nurture series.	LinkedIn Ads, email nurtures, retargeting display ads.
1:Many (150 accounts)	Thought-leadership campaign on interoperability and payer data modernization.	Blogs, infographics, social video snippets.	Paid social + organic SEO + syndication.
Convert Sales Alignment & Pipeline Influence
•	I Built a joint Sales–Marketing dashboard in Power BI integrating HubSpot and LinkedIn data to track account engagement scores.
•	I then Set up Weekly stand-ups with sales for account progress review.
•	Lastly, I Re-prioritized budget toward accounts showing >35% intent surge, resulting in 25% MQL-to-SQL conversion rate within two quarters.
Grow  Post-Sale and Advocacy ( Most Important) 
•	For the Fortune 50 client, I launched a joint innovation newsletter series and co-branded webinar for their partner ecosystem, unlocking two upsell opportunities (~$3 M total).
•	For Tier 2 accounts, I initiated a customer reference program that fed social proof into new campaigns.
Results
Metric	Outcome
Pipeline Influence	$14 M total, of which $12 M from the 1:1 account
SQL Conversion	↑ 32% in two quarters
Engagement Rate	+48% lift across LinkedIn and email
Cost Efficiency	27% reduction in CPL via ABM tiering
Learning Outcome
What this project taught me is that ABM success depends less on martech complexity and more on cross-functional sales alignment and contextual personalization. It all boils down to how fast you close the deal or set up SLA’s with the sales team to close the deal before lead goes cold especially in 1:few accounts. 
PS: Having that rapport with the sales team is imperative! If you don’t Cleary communicate the MQL needs and pain points to sales team before they dive in, all your effort will go to trash.
